01-02-01    Welcome to version 1.7. This version features clean compiles
            on following architectures and platforms:

            * Linux 2.0.X, Linux 2.1.X, Linux 2.2.X (i386)
            * FreeBSD 3.x, 4.x (i386)
            * SunOS/gcc 5.5, 5.5.1, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8 (sparc)
            * OpenBSD 2.7, 2.8
            * Tru64/gcc 
            * HPUX 11.0/gcc

            Other platforms/architectures should be supported as well, we just 
            don't have them available for testing on the moment.  
        
            There are a ton of bug fixes and new features in this version, have
            a look at the ChangeLog to see many of them.  I think that this 
            will be the last full point release of the 1.X codebase, we're 
            starting design work on the 2.0 series and I hope that we'll be 
            putting it out there in the not too distant future (less than six
            months!).  

            It's been a long road to 1.7, the amount of code in the program 
            compared to the initial release over two years ago is incredible.
            We're just getting rolling though, and 2.0 is going to bring a 
            great number of changes including more plugin interfaces (packet
            acquisition and decode), faster/cleaner code (I hope ;) and a
            better design for performing more types of analysis.

            Big changes in this version: snort-lib renamed to snort.conf, IP
            defragmentation plugin now 100% on all architectures, tcp stream
            reassembly, statistical anomaly detection, three new command line
            switches (-L,-I,-X), IP address lists, a cool "automatic variable"
            in the rules file that automatically picks up the IP address and
            netmask of a named interface, more packet header printouts, 
            detection plugins for TOS and the IP fragment bits, as well as a
            plugin that allows reference data to be attached to rules and a 
            completely rewritten active response module, etc.

            I hope everyone likes this release, we've put a ton of work into it
            to make sure that it's functional and stable while still being 
            easy to use for everyone.
            
07-22-00    Welcome to version 1.6.3.  This version features clean compiles
            on all architectures and OS's that I have access to, some 
            elusive bug fixes in the decoders, a little bit better 
            packet printing, full-time ARP packet decoding (instead of only
            when the -a option is spec'd), and an upgraded portscan
            detector.  The moral of the story with the 1.6.1->1.6.2.2 
            release cycle was "don't release when you're working on the
            road".  This will be the last version release until the
            Hiverworld IDS ships as I need to dedicate myself fully to
            that cause.  Please watch http://www.snort.org for information
            on the availability for an upgraded defragmentation 
            preprocessor, the one shipping with this version should be
            treated as *beta* code!  

07-08-00    It wouldn't be a relase without a disaster, and in that vein
            we lost the ability to compile cleanly on Linux boxes with 
            version 1.6.1.  Typical.  Lessons learned: I need to reinstall
            a RedHat box at Snort Labs so that I can do compile tests
            before release.  C'est la vie.

07-06-00    Version 1.6.1 is finally ready to see the light of day.  This
            release is mostly a bug fix with a few minor feature additions
            for runtime security.  Version 1.7 is a few months behind in 
            development due to my busy schedule at Hiverworld where I'm 
            putting together a completely new (not Snort-based) IDS.

            Version 1.7 is in development and you can check the latest
            beta functionality by checking it out from the CVS repository.
            The features that have or are going to be added include dynamic
            rules (rules that turn on other rules), variable alert levels,
            port and IP sets for rules, and a few other goodies, plus
            a slew of new plugins.

            Additionally, the snort.org web site has gone live since the
            last release, and it's pretty much a one-stop-shop for all 
            things Snort related (that and www.whitehats.com).

            I hope to have version 1.7 available by the October SANS 
            Network Security 2000 conference.

03-20-00    Bang!  Here's version 1.6, marvel at its glory! :) I'm going
            to keep this short since it's 3AM, but I think that everyone
            is going to like the changes and additions since version 1.5.
            Be sure to check out the new rules writing document at 
            http://www.clark.net/~roesch/snort_rules.html! 

02-26-00    1.6 is still in the works, but this one fixes a few problems
            with people trying to compile on SunOS/Solaris/HP-UX boxes.
            This release really falls more into the "tweak" category, but I
            think it's important enough to put out.  Version 1.6 is coming
            RSN, but will probably be a couple more weeks!

01-03-00    This one is a minor bug fix in preparation for the impending
            release of version 1.6.  Version 1.6 is in beta, but I couldn't
            hold back doing a release of this bug fix version any longer.
            Speaking of 1.6, it should be out in about two weeks, and will
            incorporate a bunch of cool new functionality.  Stay tuned!

12-8-99     Wow, almost two months since the last major release.  Well, if
            you thought the last one was big, this one is HUGE!  There are
            nine major additions to this release, including plugins, 
            session recording, improved flexibility in the rules files,
            better packet content analysis, and a bunch of other stuff.
            Snort is faster, more efficient, more flexible, and more 
            powerful than 1.3.1.  Not bad for two month's work, eh? :)

            What's down the road from here?  Well, the Token Ring decoder
            needs to get finished, and then there are three big topics that
            Snort needs to address: IP defragmentation, TCP stream 
            reassembly, and port scan detection.  Fortunately, the new
            plugin architecture implemented in this version of Snort
            makes the addition of these huge features relatively painless
            from a development standpoint.  The modules can simpley be
            developed and then dropped right into every copy of Snort
            out there.

            The really cool functional (user level) things about version 
            1.5 are session logging with the new "session" keyword, 
            multiple content tests per rule, rules file variables, and the
            IP options inspection keyword "ipopts".  Check out the 
            RULES.SAMPLE file (at the bottom) for more info on the new
            stuff.

10-13-99    Welp, here's the bug fix release.  There was one really big
            stupid bug in this one plus some other minor annoying stuff, 
            so here's a patch to clean things up a bit.  I also added some
            functionality to the dsize option keyword, you can specify
            ">" or "<" now to select ranges.

            2.0 is progressing slowly in the face of various conference 
            activity I have over the next few months.  I'm looking at a late
            November or mid-December release now, but hang in there, it's 
            coming.

09-18-99    This is probably the last 1.x release of Snort (barring a 
            possible bugfix release).  The next planned version is 2.0
            and it will be radically changed for the better.  It will 
            include a faster, more flexible detection engine, plug-in 
            support for detection, output, and monitoring modules, and
            a plethora of other options.  Look for it in late October or
            early November!

            This version includes an enhanced logging/alerting engine that
            is several times faster than the Snort 1.2.1.  The logging
            and alerting command line options are also more streamlined
            so that people may have the flexibility to choose how they log.

            Enjoy!

08-06-99    This is the official "mea culpa" version of Snort.

            Version 1.2 wasn't exactly a high quality release for 
            non-Linux platforms, and so here we are five days later with
            version 1.2.1.  Thanks to everyone's bug reports and a small
            band of volunteers, this release is much more stable than
            version 1.2 and should configure and build cleanly on
            all platforms and architectures, including Sparcs and OpenBSD.

            While all of the bug fixing was taking place, I actually found
            time to integrate some patches that people generously sent in
            during the week.  That kind of makes this release value added,
            it's not just a bug fix there's actually some new stuff in 
            here! 

            If this version proves to be stable and everyone is pretty much
            happy with the way things are working, this will be the last 
            release for a month or so.  I'm writing a paper for the LISA
            '99 conference about Snort, and I need to concentrate on 
            finishing it and getting some facts and figures about the 
            software together.  After that is done, I've got some 
            enhancements for the detection engine thought up that are
            truly radical, stay tuned..... :)

08-03-99    Oops!

08-01-99    Well, here it finally is, the big performance release.  This
            version has a slick new packet decoder and a brand spankin'
            new, fully recursive, detection engine.  It kicks ass! :)  
            Large sections of the code have been restructured to eliminate
            global data structures and streamline how much real data has
            to be passed around.  Two major global data structures have
            been eliminated to make the code more thread friendly in case
            I ever get motivated enough to multi-thread this beast.  The
            SMB alerting code is now an option, use the 
            "--enable-smbalerts" switch to the configure script if you're 
            interested in using it.  Preliminary performance testing has
            shown this version to be about twice as fast as version 1.1
            in most cases, sometimes up to 500% faster than 1.1!  There's
            a lot of new code in this release, so if anyone finds any
            bugs I'd appreciate hearing about it.  Thanks! 

06-21-99    Tons of new and improved stuff this release.  Three new command
            line options, six new rule options, eight big bugs squashed, and
            a shiny new content parser.  The WinPopup stuff was donated by 
            Damien Daspit.  It breaks one of my cardinal rules of security
            software coding (thou shalt not exec a program from within
            another), but it was so I cool I put it in pretty much 
            unmodified.  Probably in the next version I'll rig something up
            so that it will be a compile time define where you have to 
            specify a switch when you ./configure, but for now it's in.  It
            shouldn't be too much of a problem since you have to be root to
            run Snort anyway.  Trinux users can rejoice a bit, I hardcoded
            the netmasks into the program, so it no longer needs to be
            linked against libm, which was quite large to be putting on 
            floppy disks.  The new tcpdump file read option is cool, and as
            soon as I get my tcpdump file defragmenter working, Snort will 
            have the ability to decode and alert based on fragments.  C'est
            cool, no?

05-18-99    This release is primarily to fix some bugs that made it out in
            version 1.0.  At the time of release, my Sparc was broken and I
            didn't have a good way of testing the big endian/non-x86 stuff,
            so some little bugs made it out the door.  This version has 
             been tested on a real live SPARCstation 10 (Sol 2.5.1) and
            seems to work as advertised, so I'm putting it out the door.  
            This release also features support for HP-UX and S/Linux thanks
            to Chris Sylvain's nice work.  (Thanks Chris!)  There are some
            other small additions, like the packet counter statistics on 
            exit and the "-x" command line switch which allows you to 
            specifically turn on IPX packet notification (since I still 
            haven't written a IPX decoder).  The next release is going to 
            have a new and improved content parser, I've discoverd that the
            current one, uh, sucks.  See the Changelog for specifics on 
            what's fixed in this version.

04-28-99    Woohoo!  One point oh baby!  New stuff: now does SLIP and 
            RAW (PPP) packets, so all you people out there with modems can
            use Snort now too.  I also added in options to send alerts to 
            syslog.  The stability/functionality of the last release was 
            good enough for me to decide that 1.0 was ready to ship, so 
            here it is.  Enjoy!
        
04-17-99    Well, I guess I decided to change things around a bit.  I have
            rewritten about half of the rules parser so that future 
            addition of rule types people find generally interesting will be
            much easier to do.  I also totally rewrote the logging section
            so that it was more sane to write follow on code with.  Those
            are the major big changes.  I'm finally happy with the way this
            software is laid out and operates, so if this one works pretty
            well, I'll slap whatever bug fixes need to be made onto it and
            it'll really truly be version 1.0.

04-06-99    Ok, this is the big one, I think everything is stable enough 
            now for a general release.  If this one doesn't do anything 
            bizzare once it gets out into the real world, it's going to be
            version 1.0, and this time I mean it! :) Note that I'm 
            including the snort-lib template file, which has some useful
            patterns and rules that people may want to use.  Also note that
            this is version 0.99 rc5, there was no version rc4!  Ok, that's
            it for now, if anyone has any problems with this version, let
            me know!

03-24-99    Let me just say that I think I might need to implement some
            sort of formalized testing regimen before making major 
            releases.  Please pardon the last two crap releases, not enough
            time and too much work for one person to do. (lets all have a 
            pity party...)  Anyway, I beat the crap out of this version 
            with iptest and nmap, and I think it works pretty damn good 
            now.  Lets hope it continues to work well tomorrow...

03-21-99    Ok, good size update, I think this may turn out to be 1.0, but
            I'm done thinking that seriously for the time being.  Added
            TCP flag-based rules, port range rules, IP and TCP option 
            decoding, truncated packet handling, improved fragmented packet
            handling, and some bug fixing.  I'm not quite sure what else I'd
            like to put in before the 1.0 release, so I thinking this is
            going to be it.  If there's any big feature you've been wishing
            for, now's the time to ask!

03-08-99    Got a request to do more precise timestamping, so I ripped off
            the TCPDump timestamp routine and stuffed it in Snort.  You
            can now see which particular millisecond packet XYZ showed up
            in.  I'm working on the rest of the stuff....

03-06-99    Well, no new rules yet, but this program is a lot faster than
            the last release.  The two biggest bottleneck routines have been
            rewritten and are now faster and more efficient.  I've also
            started doing more complete decoding of the IP header, starting
            with the fragment data.   For those of you not using Linux, 
            collected/dropped packet statistics are now being generated
            when Snort is exited.

            The next release will (hopefully) decode the fragments and be 
            able to apply the rules set to them.  I'm also planning on 
            having IP Option decoding in the next release, plus the new 
            rules set.  Stay tuned!

02-18-99    I've started a new job and gotten one of those ergonomic 
            keyboards, so development has slowed a bit.  This release 
            focuses on minor bug fixes and code cleanup.  I'm thinking about
            changing the rules format to something with one rule argument
            per line.  This will make for larger, more readable rules files
            at the cost of more typing for the user.  It sorta sucks,
            but this is the best way I can think of to do it...

01-28-99    Content based logging is done.  With this addition, this thing
            can finally be used for light duty IDS tasks and catch most 
            things.  There still needs to be some additional work done to
            add rules for things like TCP flags, fragments, and IP options,
            but the base structure is there.

            Automatic rules sorting is implemented now too, so you can make
            your rules look as disorganized as you want.

            If nobody finds any show stopper bugs in this release, this is
            going to be 1.0!

01-19-99    Rules based packet capture is a reality now.  Added it pretty
            much all in a day or so of serious hacking.  The code is
            modularized now into excitingly chunky files.  I did this to
            avoid insanity, and I highly recommend it.  Look at the README
            file or the "RULES.SAMPLE" file to see how rules work.  I also
            fixed the seriously porked logging code, now all conversations
            end up in single files based upon the homenet address command
            line parameter, or in its absense, hi port/lo port.  I highly
            recommend using the homenet capability (-h option).

            Coming soon: Content based logging!

01-08-99    I'm thinking about putting in some "capture/pass" logic into 
            the program to facilitate rules/content based traffic capture.  
            In other words, make some kind of light intrusion detection 
            capability.  Look for it by version 1.0.
